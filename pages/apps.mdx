# `/apps`

Catalog Apps aggregates IGVF-produced and partner tools that complement the catalog itself.

## App Cards
- Each tile displays the app name and a short description curated alongside the catalog content.
- Links open in new tabs so users can keep the catalog context while referencing external portals such as FAVOR, MaveDB, the Lipids Knowledge Portal, E2G, and the IGVF Data Portal.

## Navigation
- The IGVF Catalog tile links back to `/`, effectively providing a "scroll to top" shortcut for users who landed here from the home page.

Centralising these partner links means scientists can pivot between IGVF knowledge graph summaries and specialised external resources without maintaining a separate bookmark list.
