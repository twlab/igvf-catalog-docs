# `/files`

The Files and Filesets page is the catalog's window into assay outputs. It pages through `https://api-dev.catalog.igvf.org/api/files-filesets`, hydrates the table with IGVF metadata, and links related samples back to ontology nodes.

## Filters
The filter panel reflects the query parameters passed to the API:
- **Identifiers**: lookup by file or fileset accession.
- **Lab**: choose among the labs represented in the dataset (`roderic-guigo`, `jesse-engreitz`, `j-michael-cherry`, `zhiping-weng`, `nadav-ahituv`, `bill-majoros`).
- **Assay Title, Method, Class**: restrict to the controlled vocabulary values baked into the UI (e.g., MPRA, ATAC-seq, ENCODE-rE2G predictions).
- **Donor, Sample Term, Sample Summary**: narrow the list with specific donor accessions or ontology terms.
- **Software, Source**: highlight computational pipelines or distinguish IGVF vs ENCODE-originated datasets.

Applying filters rewrites the query string; resetting clears them to the `all` sentinel recognised by the API.

## Table Behavior
- Columns include the fileset accession, lab, assay title(s), method, class, software, samples, and source. Values coming from arrays are rendered as comma-separated lists.
- Sample entries that start with `ontology_terms/` automatically resolve to `/TERM_ID` links so you can open the associated ontology page without leaving the table.
- Column visibility toggles, search, and paginated loading (25 records per API request) are available within the table toolbar.

These links let bench and computational scientists move from the fileset inventory directly into the biosample context captured elsewhere in the catalog.
