# `/glossary`

The Glossary page centralizes short-form definitions that appear throughout the catalog UI. Terms are stored in the remote glossary service (`https://fopkujtl7ol2pgmfheptp7vdwi0xbxcu.lambda-url.us-east-1.on.aws/`) and retrieved on the server before the page renders.

## Viewing Terms
- All terms load on mount and render inside a scrollable table so curators can scan the vocabulary in one place.
- When a term is missing from the upstream store during development, the glossary backend can seed placeholder language automatically; in production the page simply reports the term as unavailable.

## Editing Definitions
- Selecting **Edit** opens an in-place dialog that lets authorized users update the definition. Saves call the glossary endpoint with the password entered in the dialog.
- The UI prompts for the password every time; no credentials are persisted in the browser.
- A companion `/glossary/edit?t=TERM` route lets contributors propose revised language without direct write access. Suggestions are stored via the glossary suggestion API and later reviewed.
- `/glossary/edit-requests` is the moderation surface where curators approve or reject suggestions, with status updates written back through the lambda-backed service so terminology stays aligned across the catalog, docs, and downstream tooling.
