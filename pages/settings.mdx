# `/settings`

The Settings page stores UI preferences in the browser so users can configure graph styling without affecting collaborators.

## Node Styling
- **Edit Node Styles** lets you assign custom colours to core node types (gene, protein, transcript, drug, variant, study). Colours persist in the browser so personal preferences stick across sessions.
- You can toggle dashed edges for any supported node type, which affects how relationships render in `/[node_id]/live-graph`.
- Edge thickness is adjustable with a numeric control (default 10, recommended 5–15) and can be reset to the baked-in baseline.

## Display Preferences
- **Compact Display** toggles the layout preference shared across tables and cards. Turning it on switches components into tighter spacing, which is helpful when reviewing large result sets.

Taken together, the styling controls help researchers adjust colours, line styles, and density so variant–gene–disease chains remain readable without sacrificing personal accessibility needs.
