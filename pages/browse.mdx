# `/browse`

The Browse Data page gives a tabbed view into the literature-derived assets that back the Lexical search experience. Each tab streams CSV slices from `https://glkb.dcmb.med.umich.edu/api` and rewrites identifiers so they resolve inside the catalog.

## Tabs and Datasets
- **Articles** (`/files/articles`) lists PubMed entries with titles, authors, citations, and DOIs. PMIDs open the catalog article view at `/PMID:*`.
- **Article Topics** (`/files/article_topics`) shows topic assignments that pair PMIDs with ontology identifiers. Vocabulary IDs are converted to internal routes like `/MONDO_0000001` when the prefix is recognized.
- **Citations** (`/files/citations`) renders citing â†’ cited PMID pairs so you can walk bibliographies without losing the catalog context.
- **Semantic Relationships** (`/files/semantic_relationships`) surfaces text-mined links between ontology terms. Supporting PMIDs fan out as expandable lists that again link into `/PMID:*` detail pages.
- **Vocabularies** (`/files/vocabularies`) exposes the concept registry that powers entity name search, including synonyms and descriptions, with in-catalog links for any supported ontology prefixes.

## Interaction Details
- Infinite scrolling loads additional results automatically as you approach the end of each tab.
- Error states from the GLKB API are surfaced inline via alert banners; successful fetches show structured cards instead of raw CSV.
- A back link returns to `/lexical`, keeping browse, search, lookup, and cypher workflows connected.

That combination makes it easy to audit which publications, vocabularies, and semantic edges are already indexed and to jump straight into the matching IGVF article or ontology pages.
