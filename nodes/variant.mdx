# Overview

The **IGVF Catalog** contains *variant* nodes primarily sourced from [FAVOR](https://favor.genohub.org/).  
Variants not present in FAVOR but present in the other variant collections below were also loaded.  
Variants may be identified using **SPDI**, **HGVS**, or their **genomic position**.
