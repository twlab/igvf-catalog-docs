# Overview

The **IGVF Catalog** contains *variant* nodes primarily sourced from [FAVOR](https://favor.genohub.org/).  
Variants not present in FAVOR but present in the other variant collections below were also loaded.  
Variants may be identified using **rsid**, **SPDI**, **HGVS**, or their **genomic position**.

## Coding Variant Effects

### Coding Variant Measurements (table)
This table presents measurements of effects of coding variants in experimental assays. Currently, this table presents IGVF data from 2 assays. 

[VAMP-seq](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-018-0122-z) measures the effects of coding variants on protein abundance. Lower scores indicate lower abundance of the alternative allele versus reference allele. 

[SGE](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43041-4) (saturation genome editing) measures the effects of coding variants on **ADD MORE HERE**.
