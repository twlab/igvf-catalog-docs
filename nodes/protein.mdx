# Protein
## Identifiers and Primary Sources

The IGVF Catalog has protein nodes collection with Ensembl Protein IDs (e.g., `ENSP00000384707`) as identifiers from the following [GENCODE](link) releases:
* **Human:** [GENCODE v43](https://www.gencodegenes.org/human/release_43.html)
* **Mouse:** [GENCODE vM36](https://www.gencodegenes.org/mouse/release_M36.html)

Information from [UniProt](https://www.uniprot.org) are also integrated as properties on each node, including UniProt IDs (e.g., `P49711`), protein names, and Database cross-reference (dbxref). The data was imported from the following UniProt files (downloaded in May 2024):
* **Human:** [uniprot_sprot_human.dat.gz](https://data.igvf.org/reference-files/IGVFFI4731NANO/), [uniprot_trembl_human.dat.gz](https://data.igvf.org/reference-files/IGVFFI8551EYSR/) 
* **Mouse:** [uniprot_sprot_rodents.dat.gz](https://data.igvf.org/reference-files/IGVFFI3157HIUW/), [uniprot_trembl_rodents.dat.gz](https://data.igvf.org/reference-files/IGVFFI6972ORPG/)

# Coding variants
## Identifiers and Primary Sources

The IGVF Catalog has coding variants collection using identifiers combining Ensembl Transcript ID and HGVS nomenclature for both protein and cDNA changes (e.g., `HK1_ENST00000298649_p.Arg380Gly_c.1138C>G`). Each coding variant is also mapped to its genomic location using standardized SPDI identifiers.

The primary source is [dbNSFP v5.1](https://www.dbnsfp.org), which aggregates scores from dozens of functional prediction algorithms (e.g., SIFT, CADD) for all possible non-synonymous single-nucleotide variants (nsSNVs) and splice-site variants in the human genome. Additionally, predictions on coding variants functions from [Mutpred2](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-19669-x) and [ESM-1v](https://github.com/facebookresearch/esm) for every possible single amino acid change in human genes are imported as part of the IGVF project.  As part of this import process, all possible genetic indels that could lead to each specific amino acid change were enumerated and included.
