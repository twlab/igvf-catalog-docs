# Genes

The  official gene sets of the IGVF Catalog is from the following [GENCODE](link) releases:
* **Human:** [GENCODE v43](https://www.gencodegenes.org/human/release_43.html)
* **Mouse:** [GENCODE vM36](https://www.gencodegenes.org/mouse/release_M36.html)

Gene and Transcripts and Gene Structure (UTRs, Exons etc.)  are loaded from the comprehensive annotation file as nodes.
This includes all protein-coding, lncRNA and all other gene types annotated by GENCODE
