# Genes

The official gene set of the IGVF Catalog is from [GENCODE V43](https://www.gencodegenes.org/human/release_43.html). 
Gene and Transcripts and Gene Structure (UTRs, Exons etc.)  are loaded from the comprehensive annotation file as nodes.
This includes all protein-coding, lncRNA and all other gene types annotated by GENCODE

## Coding Variant Functional and Prediction scores

## Predicted Enhancers Table

This table shows enhancers that are predicted to regulate the gene you're viewing.

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Cell Type | The specific cell type for the prediction |
| Score | The strength of the prediction (higher is stronger) |
| Model | The predictive model used |
| Dataset | The source dataset (click for more information) |
| Enhancer Type | The type of enhancer predicted |
| Enhancer Region | The genomic coordinates of the predicted enhancer (click to view the region) |

## Proteins Table

This table displays information about proteins associated with the gene.

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Protein ID | Unique identifier for the protein (click for more details) |
| Protein Name | Common name of the protein |
| Full Name | Complete scientific name of the protein |
| Source | Origin of the protein information (click for source details if available) |

## Transcripts Table

This table shows different transcripts (RNA versions) of the gene. Genes are linked to transcripts via gene-transcript edges (also from GENCODE).

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Region | Genomic location of the transcript (click to view the region) |
| Transcript ID | Unique identifier for the transcript (click for more details) |
| Transcript Name | Name of the transcript (click for more information) |
| Gene Name | Name of the gene this transcript belongs to (click for gene details) |
| Source | Origin of the transcript information (click for source details if available) |
| Version | Version number of the transcript information |

## Variants Table.  Variants are linked to genes via both functional characterization experiments and QTLs.
[IGVFDS4359OODY](https://data.igvf.org/analysis-sets/IGVFDS4359OODY/) shows the effect of 183 variants in the PPIF promoter 
measured _via_ a CRISPR method called Variant-EFFECTS.  
eQTLs and splice-QTLs are encoded as gene-variant edges.  Datasets have been loaded from the EBI [eQTL catalogue](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/eqtl/).  Additional QTLs have been loaded from the [African Functional Genomics; AFGR](https://github.com/smontgomlab/AFGR) resource.

This table presents genetic variants associated with the gene.

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Region | Genomic location of the variant (click to view the region) |
| rsID | Reference SNP ID(s) for the variant (click for more details) |
| Source | Origin of the variant information (click for source details if available) |
| SPDI | A standardized representation of the variant |




They are also linked to other genes, variants, diseases, and genomic elements

## Other Edge Types (UI in development)
### Gene-Gene Edges
There are two public sources of gene-gene edges; A coxpression matrix from [CoexpressDB](https://coxpresdb.jp/) and genetic interactions from [BioGRID](https://thebiogrid.org)
