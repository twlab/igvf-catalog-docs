IGVF Catalog comprehensive repository designed to facilitate access to a wide range of genomic data, particularly focused on sequence variants, their associated genes, and regulatory elements. This catalog enables researchers, clinicians, and bioinformaticians to explore relationships between variants and biological processes, including the effects on gene expression, regulatory regions, and disease phenotypes.
